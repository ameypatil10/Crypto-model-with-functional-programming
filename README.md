# Crypto-model-with-functional-programming

Our Project is about implementation of Cryptographic Ciphers and Cipher attacks (for ciphers easier to break). So we have implemented following 6 Cryptographic ciphers and a Hacker algorithm :
1. Caesar Shift Cipher 2. Scytale Cipher
3. Vigin√®re Cipher
4. One-Time-Pad Cipher 5. Enigma Cipher
6. Advanced Encryption Standard (A.E.S.) 7. Hacker

And to combine them we made a very simple GUI interface to make the whole project user friendly and interactive. Basically our whole project is all about implementing the Encryption and Decryption Algorithms in Racket .To see the implementation of the project please run the the main.rkt file
